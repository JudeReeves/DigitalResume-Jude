            <h3>Qualus</h3>
            <p>Electrical Enginnering Intern (May 2024 - August 2024)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Utilized CDEGS to model and analyze ground grids for substation design to ensure touch and step voltages were 
                    below the threshold set by the client. Responsible for the modeling, soil analysis, and grounding analysis of a 
                    150MW photovoltaic site. </li>
                <li>Modeled and reported studies such as short circuit, load flow, harmonics, and arc flash using modeling software 
                    such as ETAP and SKM for photovoltaic and industrial sites. </li>
                    <li>Performed protective device coordination, and utilized SEL Acselerator to set the files for SEL 300, 400, and 700 
                        series relays. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mississippi State University</h3>
            <p>Undergraduate Research Assistant (October 2023 - Present)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Performed various tasks for research on electric motors within the electrical engineering department for a National 
                    Science Foundation-funded project. Utilized Autodesk AutoCAD to design components of electric motors and 
                    ANSYS Maxwell for simulation. </li>
                <li>Responsible for communication between the engineering team, MS State Entrepreneurship Center, and industry 
                    partners to gain a position at an NSF I-Corp program </li>

            <h3>Clearwater Paper Company</h3>
            <p>Electrical Engineering Intern (May 2023 - August 2023)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaborated with an engineering firm to calculate arc flash incident energy using EasyPower and IEEE 1584
                    2018 for the mill-wide power distribution. Identified and labeled over 400 points in the power system that required 
                    arc flash warnings. </li>
                <li>Proposed and awarded $120k for a new system that needed CLO2 alarms in an area that regularly had CLO2 
                    leaks. Revised the old system with 11 alarms daisy chained in a single loop. Planned a new system with 5 
                    different zones individually supplied from PLC outputs. Gathered quotes and scopes of work and presented them 
                    to the capital budget team. </li>
                <li>Revised electrical drawings using AutoCAD Electrical. Drafted new drawings for a fire pump wiring, MCC buckets, 
                    CL2 well valve, and multiple PLC cards. </li>
            </ul>
